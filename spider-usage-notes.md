- I noticed it went a bit overboard, but you can see it's trying to think about production issue from the start. 
- It doesn't always follow the protocol exactly. You have to be diligent to get it to follow the protocol. 
- It overspecced things -- part of the context is things like is this likely to be a server than in the first realease has to deal with rate limiting? 
- Here's what happened after the spec was done. 

    1. LLM Interface: Replaced regex/pattern matching with Claude Sonnet integration - CRUD
  operations exposed as tools
  1. Removed Overkill Features:
    - No rate limiting, WCAG compliance, or complex caching
    - No performance tests, E2E tests, or golden test sets
    - No backup files, file locking, or complex atomic writes
    - Reduced from 10,000 to ~500 todos max
  2. Simplified Requirements: Basic file operations, simple UI, manual testing
  3. Added UI Discussion: Listed framework options for your input

  üéØ Core Focus Now:

  - Simple todo CRUD operations
  - Clean web UI with traditional checkbox interface
  - LLM-powered conversational interface using Claude
  - Flat file storage (simple JSON)
  - Responsive design with Zustand state management

  ‚ùì Need Your Input:

  Which UI framework would you prefer?
  1. Tailwind CSS - Utility-first, highly customizable
  2. shadcn/ui - Beautiful components built on Radix + Tailwind
  3. Material-UI (MUI) - Full component library
  4. Plain CSS/modules - Simple, no dependencies

  The specification is now much leaner and focused on delivering a working product without
  unnecessary complexity. Ready to proceed once you choose the UI framework!

  - I said shadcn.

Initially I said a file-based list. But as we worked through it and the plan, it turned file-based was actually way more headache than I thought it would be. The point is it wasn't a fixed process -- I told it to go back and fix it. 

- There are issues with compliance. It doesn't always consult at the end of the phase. The human sometimes has to remind it. 

I used the spider-updater and here are the choices it came to me with: 

 Major Improvements to Adopt:

  1. Revert "reviews" back to "lessons" - They consistently use lessons/ which is clearer terminology
  2. Stronger I-D-E enforcement - Add mandatory language to prevent skipping Defend/Evaluate phases
  3. Immediate test writing requirement - Tests must be written alongside implementation, not retroactively
  4. Remove the phase completion checklist - It's redundant and overly prescriptive
  5. Move time estimate warning inline - Better placement in the plan output section
