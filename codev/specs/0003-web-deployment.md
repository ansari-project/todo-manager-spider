# Specification: Web Deployment for Todo Manager

## Specification ID: 0003

## Executive Summary
Deploy the Todo Manager DEMONSTRATION application to showcase the SPIDER protocol and codev methodology. This is not a production application but a technical demonstration of AI-assisted todo management with conversational interface.

## Problem Statement

### Current State
- Application runs locally on development machines only
- Requires manual setup of environment variables
- MCP server runs as a separate process

**Technical Requirements**:
- Container orchestration setup
- Load balancer configuration
- Database setup and management
- CI/CD pipeline configuration

## Recommended Approach

**Primary Choice: Vercel** for immediate deployment with following adaptations:
1. Use Vercel Postgres or Neon for database
2. Refactor MCP server integration to work within API route constraints
3. Implement aggressive caching for static content
4. Use edge functions where appropriate

**Fallback Option: Railway** if MCP server integration proves problematic on Vercel:
1. Use Railway's PostgreSQL add-on
2. Deploy as single container with process management
3. Add Cloudflare for CDN if needed

## Implementation Considerations

### Database Migration
- From SQLite to PostgreSQL
- Drizzle ORM already supports both
- Need to update connection strings
- Test migrations thoroughly

### MCP Server Adaptation
- **Option A**: Inline MCP tools directly in API routes (no separate server)
- **Option B**: Deploy MCP server as separate service (microservices architecture)
- **Option C**: Use background workers for long-running operations

### Environment Variables Required
```
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=xxx
DATABASE_URL=xxx
NEXTAUTH_URL=xxx (if adding auth)
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=xxx
```

### Monitoring and Observability
- Error tracking (Sentry)
- Performance monitoring
- Uptime monitoring
- Log aggregation

## Success Criteria

1. **Deployment Success**
   - Application accessible via HTTPS URL
   - All features working as in local development
   - No data loss during normal operations

2. **Performance Metrics**
   - 95th percentile response time < 3s
   - Zero failed requests under normal load
   - Successful handling of 100 concurrent users

3. **Operational Metrics**
   - Deployment time < 5 minutes
   - Rollback capability < 1 minute
   - Zero-downtime deployments achieved

## Open Questions

### Critical (Blocks Progress)
1. Should we implement user authentication now or deploy as single-user initially?
2. Is the 10-second Vercel timeout acceptable for complex AI operations?
3. Do we need to implement rate limiting before public deployment?

### Important (Affects Design)
1. How should we handle MCP server process in serverless environment?
2. Should conversation history be user-specific or session-based?
3. What's the backup strategy for production data?

### Nice-to-Know
1. Should we add analytics tracking?
2. Do we want custom domain immediately?
3. Should we implement A/B testing capability?

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| API key exposure | High | Medium | Use environment variables, implement rate limiting |
| Database connection exhaustion | High | Medium | Connection pooling, query optimization |
| MCP server crashes | Medium | Medium | Health checks, automatic restarts, fallback responses |
| Unexpected traffic spike | Medium | Low | Auto-scaling, rate limiting, CDN caching |
| Data loss | High | Low | Regular backups, point-in-time recovery |

## Dependencies
- Existing todo manager application
- Anthropic API key for production
- Domain name (optional)
- SSL certificate (automatic with most platforms)

### Updated Analysis: Learning from MAIX Implementation

#### MAIX's Successful Vercel-Only Deployment

The maix project (github.com/ansari-project/maix) successfully deploys MCP on Vercel using:

1. **HTTP-based MCP Transport**
   - Uses `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` with `StreamableHTTPClientTransport`
   - No stdio process required
   - Tools defined directly in API routes using `mcp-handler` package

2. **Simple Architecture**
   - Single `/api/mcp` route handles all MCP requests
   - Tools are regular async functions within the route
   - No separate server process or complex orchestration

#### Revised Architecture for Demonstration App

**Since this is a DEMONSTRATION app, not production:**
- Simplicity > Production-grade features
- Pure Vercel deployment is preferred
- No need for rate limiting, authentication, or complex security
- Focus on showcasing SPIDER protocol methodology

#### Simplified Requirements for Demonstration

**As a DEMO app:**
- No authentication required initially
- Basic API key protection (environment variable)
- No rate limiting needed for demo
- Focus on functionality over security hardening
- Can add basic auth later if needed for cost control

#### 3. Database & Connection Management

**Critical Requirements Identified:**
- Use serverless-optimized drivers (@neondatabase/serverless)
- Avoid node-postgres pooling in serverless
- Co-locate DB and function regions
- Implement migration pipeline via CI/CD
- Enable Point-in-Time Recovery

#### 4. Timeout & Cost Management

**Consensus on Async Architecture:**
- Queue-based processing for operations >30s
- Implement job IDs with SSE status updates
- Set strict token budgets and tool timeouts
- Cost alerts and spending limits essential

#### 5. Production Readiness Gaps

**Must Address Before Launch:**
- Backup and restore procedures tested
- Monitoring: Sentry + metrics + uptime checks
- Load testing (100 concurrent users minimum)
- Graceful timeout handling
- PII scrubbing in logs
