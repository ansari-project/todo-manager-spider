# Specification: Example Feature

## Metadata
- **ID**: spec-2025-01-19-example
- **Status**: draft
- **Author**: Codev Team
- **Created**: 2025-01-19
- **Multi-Agent**: false

## Problem Statement
This is an example specification to demonstrate the SP(IDE)R protocol structure. In a real project, this would describe an actual problem that needs solving.

## Current State
Currently, users need to understand how to use the Codev methodology by reading documentation alone.

## Desired State
Users should have a concrete example showing how specifications are structured and how they flow into plans and implementation.

## Stakeholders
- **Primary Users**: Developers using Codev
- **Secondary Users**: Team leads evaluating methodologies
- **Technical Team**: Codev maintainers

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Example specification demonstrates all required sections
- [ ] Clear demonstration of the three-approach requirement
- [ ] Shows how open questions are categorized
- [ ] All tests pass with >90% coverage
- [ ] Documentation is clear and complete

## Constraints
### Technical Constraints
- Must work with existing Codev structure
- Should be simple enough to understand quickly

### Business Constraints
- Should be completed as part of initial release
- No additional dependencies

## Assumptions
- Users have basic understanding of development methodologies
- Git and markdown familiarity assumed

## Solution Approaches

### Approach 1: Simple Example
**Description**: Create a basic example showing minimal required structure

**Pros**:
- Easy to understand
- Quick to implement

**Cons**:
- May not show all features
- Could oversimplify

**Estimated Complexity**: Low
**Risk Level**: Low

### Approach 2: Real-World Scenario
**Description**: Use an actual feature implementation as the example

**Pros**:
- More realistic
- Shows actual workflow

**Cons**:
- More complex
- Takes longer to understand

**Estimated Complexity**: Medium
**Risk Level**: Low

### Approach 3: Interactive Tutorial
**Description**: Create a step-by-step tutorial with exercises

**Pros**:
- Most educational
- Hands-on learning

**Cons**:
- Most complex to create
- Requires maintenance

**Estimated Complexity**: High
**Risk Level**: Medium

## Open Questions

### Critical (Blocks Progress)
- [ ] Which approach best serves new users?

### Important (Affects Design)
- [ ] Should examples include multi-agent consultation?

### Nice-to-Know (Optimization)
- [ ] Could we automate example generation?

## Performance Requirements
- **Response Time**: N/A for documentation
- **Throughput**: N/A
- **Resource Usage**: Minimal
- **Availability**: Available with main documentation

## Security Considerations
- No security implications for example documentation

## Test Scenarios
### Functional Tests
1. User can follow example to create their own specification
2. All links and references work correctly
3. Templates are properly referenced

## Dependencies
- **External Services**: None
- **Internal Systems**: Codev protocol templates
- **Libraries/Frameworks**: None

## References
- [Codev README](/README.md)
- [SP(IDE)R Protocol](/codev/protocols/spider/protocol.md)
- [Specification Template](/codev/protocols/spider/templates/spec.md)

## Risks and Mitigation
| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|------------|--------|-------------------|
| Example too complex | Low | Medium | Keep it minimal |
| Example becomes outdated | Medium | High | Link to templates |

## Expert Consultation
**Date**: [To be completed]
**Model**: [To be consulted]
**Key Feedback**:
- [To be added after consultation]

## Approval
- [ ] Technical Lead Review
- [ ] Product Owner Review
- [ ] Stakeholder Sign-off
- [ ] Expert AI Consultation Complete

## Notes
This example specification serves as both documentation and a template for users starting with Codev.
